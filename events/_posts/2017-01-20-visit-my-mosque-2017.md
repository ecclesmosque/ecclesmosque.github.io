# You are cordially invited to visit Eccles Mosque Open Day on 5 February 2017.

**On behalf of the congregation and {{ site.subtitle }}, I would like to invite you to an Open Mosque Day, to be held on the 5th of February from 12 pm to 5 pm.**

{{ site.subtitle }} is taking part in the national [#VisitMyMosque](http://www.visitmymosque.org) initiative and in the spirit of friendship and conversation, we hope to give members of the local community an engaging insight into the life of the mosque and to promote greater understanding of Islam. We anticipate welcoming local people from all walks of life to visit the mosque and meet with its diverse Muslim congregation.

The open attitude of the mosque and its people make a major contribution in fostering interfaith and intercultural understanding in the local community.

We would be honoured to have your presence on the day between 12 pm and 5 pm. In particular, if you are able to arrive by 12 pm we will begin proceedings with a meet & greet, then proceed to observe a congregational prayer, followed by light refreshments and a tour of the building. Please contact me by telephone or email to confirm your attendance or for further information. Please also let me know of any dietary requirements as well.

Yours in good faith,


Azizur Rahman <br/>
