# You are cordially invited to visit {{ site.title }} Open Day on {{ page.startDate | date_to_long_string }}.

**On behalf of the congregation and {{ site.subtitle }}, we would like to invite you to an Open Mosque Day, to be held on the {{ page.startDate | date_to_long_string }} from {{ page.startDate | date: "%I:%M %P" }} to {{ page.endDate | date: "%I:%M %P" }}.**


{{ site.subtitle }} is taking part in the national [#VisitMyMosque](http://www.visitmymosque.org) initiative and in the spirit of friendship and conversation we hope to give members of the local community an engaging insight into the life of the mosque and to promote greater understanding of Islam. We anticipate welcoming local people from all walks of life to visit the mosque and meet with its diverse Muslim population.

{{ site.subtitle }} has a daily congregation of about 60 people and on Friday prayers it attracts more than 500 worshippers. Its unusual classical architecture draws visitors from schools and the public throughout the year. The open attitude of the mosque and its people make a major contribution in fostering interfaith and intercultural understanding in the local community.

We would be honoured to have your presence on either one of the sessions between 1pm and 4pm. The first session (A) will take place between 1pm – 2:30pm, and the second session (B) will take place between 2:30pm – 4pm. You are free to attend either one or both.
