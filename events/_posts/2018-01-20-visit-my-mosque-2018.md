# You are cordially invited to visit {{ site.title }} Open Day on {{ page.startDate | date_to_long_string }}.

**On behalf of the congregation and {{ site.subtitle }}, I would like to invite you to an Open Mosque Day, to be held on the {{ page.startDate | date_to_long_string }} from {{ page.startDate | date: "%I:%M %P" }} to {{ page.endDate | date: "%I:%M %P" }}.**

{{ site.subtitle }} is taking part in the national [#VisitMyMosque](http://www.visitmymosque.org) initiative and in the spirit of **Open Doors, Open Mosques, and Open Communities**.

A family-friendly event: We want to better accept, honour, celebrate and facilitate the hand of friendship. A great opportunity to learn more about the true joy Muslims are and their amazing contributions.

**We have a range of _free activities_ from**
* Guided Tours
* Observe Prayer
* Opportunity to ask questions
* Engaging discussion
* Finger buffet
* Books & Leaflets
* Henna Painting
* Arabic Calligraphy
* And much more!

**No registration needed, just turn up!**

This is a family-friendly event in which we extend a hand of friendship to the community as a whole. A great opportunity to learn more about what is Islam and what the Muslim community is really about.

The open attitude of the mosque and its people make a major contribution in fostering interfaith and intercultural understanding in the local community.

We would be honoured to have your presence on the day between {{ page.startDate | date: "%I:%M %P" }} and {{ page.endDate | date: "%I:%M %P" }}. In particular, if you are able to arrive by {{ page.doorTime | date: "%I:%M %P" }} we will begin proceedings with a meet & greet, then proceed to observe a congregational prayer, followed by light refreshments and a tour of the Mosque. Please contact me by telephone or email to confirm your attendance or for further information. Please also let me know of any dietary requirements as well.
