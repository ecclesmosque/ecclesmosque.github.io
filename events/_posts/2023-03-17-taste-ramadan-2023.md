Re: Invitation to Taste Ramadan Communal Dinner

Dear Neighbour,

We hope that this message reaches you in the best of health & happiness.

Ramadan is an auspicious time for Muslims; wherein one reflects and contemplates much on the relationship we have with God Almighty. We feel privileged, as a pillar of the Eccles/Salford community, to be able to provide a facility where we can open the fasts of the local Muslim community. We would, therefore, like to cordially invite you, our fellow neighbours from all faiths or none, to share in this festive experience and join us for the annual Iftar Meal.

Join us for an Iftar dinner (a celebratory meal to break the fast) hosted by Eccles Mosque as part of the national initiative, Taste Ramadan! Taste Ramadan welcomes people from all faiths & backgrounds interested in connecting with the community & learning about other cultures. Share in the blessings, build bonds and explore different cultures this Ramadan.

Doors open at 5.45pm, with refreshments, stalls, tours, roam around, chatâ€¦ from 6pm-7pm. Main presentations will start at 7pm followed by the main meal/dinner on the first floor at 8pm.

**Date:** {{ page.startDate | date: '%A, %d %B %Y' }}

**Time:** {{ page.startDate | date: '%I:%M %P' }}

**Location:** Eccles Mosque, 5 Liverpool road, Eccles, Manchester, M30 0WB
