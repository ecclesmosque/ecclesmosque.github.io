Dear Guests who attended {{ site.subtitle }} last night,

Words can't explain how amazing and powerful such a get together was and we are highly appreciative for all those who attended. It was no doubt the best wider community gathering we have probably had in the history this mosque. It was a beautiful feeling to see around 150 guests and then the 150 in addition from the Muslim community. From the Muslim community perspective, all you wonderful guests could not have been hand picked any better!

We don't want it to end there, we want to continue being more comfortable to keep our doors open with your support. Your attendance and reassurance for the Muslim community were invaluable. Last night was surely a starting point and all present feel that justice could not be done in two hours as we have so much to share and celebrate.

There is no doubt in this blessed month of Ramadan amazing things happen. We want to continue with the 8.30pm-10.30pm for the rest the remaining 13 or so days of Ramadan. Kindly [register your interest](https://goo.gl/forms/Y7lKRZAqASM31nFT2) and we shall allocate you evenings for smaller groups.
