## Eid prayers

Due to the ongoing Covid-19 restrictions, Eccles Mosque and Islamic Society will remain closed during Eid. This means our sunnah of Eid salaah will not be held in the Mosque or any public spaces such as parks or car parks.

The conditions of Eid salaah are the same as Jumah salah and we encourage our community to pray this at home with family where possible. Please view the conditions and guidance below for both Shaf’i and Hanafi rulings.

## Zakatul Fitr

Originally this was the giving of a certain amount of food to the needy, but nowadays most people give money to pay for the food. This has been set at £5, and should be paid for each and every member of the family, including children.

Zakatul Fitr can be paid from the beginning of Ramadan; we advise people to do so as early as possible, to make it easier to reach the needy recipients in time.

The latest it can be given is just before the Eid prayer, but delaying it this long means there’s no time to get food to the needy for Eid day. Remember, in the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him), people gave food directly to the needy, so there was no delay.

{{ site.subtitle }} will collect your Zakatul Fitr, or you can use one of the many registered Muslim charities.

Abu Dharr (r.a.) narrated that Allah's Messenger (s.a.w.s.) said:

> "Those who have much wealth (in this world) will be the least rewarded (in the Hereafter) except those who do like this and like this (i.e., spend their money in charity)."
