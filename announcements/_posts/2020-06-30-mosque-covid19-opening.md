Dear respected brothers and sisters in Islam

By the grace of Allah (SWT), we are pleased to announce, under strict Covid-19 rules, the re-opening of Eccles masjid on **Saturday 4th July 2020** for congregational prayers, marriage ceremonies and funeral services. Friday (jumaa) prayers will also commence on a trial basis.

We have implemented a new risk assessment policy and have appointed a Covid-19 Operation officer, safety officers and a medical team, who will work together to ensure everyone’s safety.

Measures being put in place to ensure everyone’s safety include:

- A deep clean and sanitisation of all areas, in and around the centre prior to the opening
- Floor markings to ensure social distancing and one-way systems
- Posters relaying govt advice and identifying relevant stations (temp control, hand washing etc)
- All children under the age of 10 will not be allowed to access the masjid. Children of the age of 10-12 must be accompanied by parents/ guardian
- Wudu areas will be closed to stop the spread of infection
- All post Sunnah and Nawafil prayers are to be prayed at home
- We encourage all those in high-risk categories not to attend the masjid, these include;
  - If you are currently not well for any reason or showing symptoms of covid-19
  - Elders (70+)
  - Those with illnesses such as diabetes, heart disease, asthma and others who are vulnerable
  - Those in high risk occupations who are more likely to have been in contact with others who have the virus

Daily Prayers:

- Congregation in the masjid will be limited to 5 daily prayers. The masjid will be open for 15 minutes before the Iqamah and closed immediately after the conclusion of farth prayers
- There are limited spaces in the masjid due to social distancing rules, so please expect to queue outside pending all relevant checks before entry
- All attendees will be expected to provide their details in line with the test and trace program
- A social distancing rule of 2m will be adhered to at all times
- A face mask is recommended for daily prayers, but will be an obligation for Jumaa
- A One-way system will be used to ease the entering and exiting of the masjid
- Shoe racks will be sealed, so everyone must bring their own bag to store their footwear, which must be kept by your side at all times
- Everyone must also bring their own musalla and prayer hat

**Please respect all volunteers by kindly adhering to all the rules set out above your cooperation is essential in keeping our masjid open**
