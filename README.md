# How to preview a draft post

Normally (and on GitHub Pages) Jekyll will ignore the posts in the `_drafts` folder, publishing only the posts in the `_posts` folder. If you run Jekyll locally with the `--drafts` flag (e.g., `jekyll serve --drafts`), Jekyll will include any posts in the `_drafts` folder, just as if they were published post (but don't worry, only locally).
