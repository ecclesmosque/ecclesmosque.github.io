**Due to expected difficulty citing the moon on Monday July 4, Eid al-Fitr announcement is expected to be made after 10pm on Monday, July 4, 2016, In-Shaa- Allah.**

Don’t forget to pay your [Zakat al-Fitr](#zakatul-fitr). The minimum amount is £4 per person, which can be paid at the collection box at the back of Main Prayer Hall. It MUST be paid BEFORE you perform your Eid prayer.

## Eid prayers

We will be holding two Eid prayers this year.

* 8.30am and
* 9.30am.

## Zakatul Fitr

Originally this was the giving of a certain amount of food to the needy, but nowadays most people give money to pay for the food. This has been set at £4, and should be paid for each and every member of the family, including children.

Zakatul Fitr can be paid from the beginning of Ramadan; we advise people to do so as early as possible, to make it easier to reach the needy recipients in time.

The latest it can be given is just before the Eid prayer, but delaying it this long means there’s no time to get food to the needy for Eid day. Remember, in the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him), people gave food directly to the needy, so there was no delay.

{{ site.subtitle }} will collect your Zakatul Fitr, or you can use one of the many registered Muslim charities.

Abu Dharr (r.a.) narrated that Allah's Messenger (s.a.w.s.) said:

> "Those who have much wealth (in this world) will be the least rewarded (in the Hereafter) except those who do like this and like this (i.e., spend their money in charity)."
